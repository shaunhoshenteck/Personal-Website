                                <li>Used Processing, a flexible software sketchbook, to design and implement a board game called 'Reversi' with Python.</li>
                                <li>Designed Disk, Board, Game Controller, and Player classes.</li>
                                <li>Implemented classes that launched the initial set up of the board, determined whose turn it would be, as well as the ability to flip the color of disks if a valid move was selected.</li>
                                <li>Improved user experience by displaying which tiles were flipped, announcing the winner as well as the scores after every game, and inputting results of every game on to a leaderboard.</li>
                                <li>Designed a simple AI opponent to make the game more challenging.</li>

                                <li>implemented a command-line parser to determine what the client wants and allows flexibility in how the 'to-do' list is generated.</li>
                                <li>Used a Builder pattern to create 'to-do' objects.</li>
